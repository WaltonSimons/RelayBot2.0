- Version 2.0: Core functionality. Still being developed. Will be considered complete when the bot has all the functions of the previous version.
- Version 2.0.1: Plugin API changed. No longer throws exceptions if functions are not overloaded by inheriting classes. Adds two new hooks to be called when users enter/exit chatrooms. Allows plugins to expose the commands they react to, if any, or return None to inform they cannot be called from chat.
